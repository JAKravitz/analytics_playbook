# Confidence API (`confidence-api`)

## Document control
- **API ID:** confidence-api
- **Verticals:** agriculture
- **Kind:** core
- **Sensor / access tier:** Both
- **Grade:** inventory
- **Status:** aurora · **API ready:** live
- **Doc:** Playbook v0.1 · May 2026 — replace with owner-reviewed version as methods mature.

## Spectral uplift
- **MSI baseline:** Confidence from temporal consistency and clear-sky frequency.
- **VNIR HSI adds:** Confidence informed by spectral fit quality across red-edge and VNIR water features.
- **VNIR-SWIR HSI adds:** Full-curve spectral fit including SWIR — highest confidence; uncertainty bounds tighter on attribution.

## Purpose and scope
Core API endpoint in the Field Stress Monitor base package — stress, identity, state, traits, and supporting signals that add-ons build on.

**Catalog notes:** Confidence and uncertainty on all base outputs.

**Inventory grade** in the playbook sense: suitable as a repeatable catalog deliverable where validation and QA paths are defined for supported domains.

Catalog status: **Aurora**. API ready: **live**.

## Definition
Raster (or agreed vector) layer representing **Confidence API**. Exact units, classes, and dynamic range are specified in the delivery metadata for each order.

## Inputs and dependencies
**Firefly and/or open datasets**, depending on product configuration. Atmospherically corrected reflectance where applicable. Quality masks (cloud/shadow) recommended for interpretation.

## Method summary
Pipeline-specific retrieval or classifier consistent with the API kind and tier; detailed algorithm version is tracked per release.

## Outputs and deliverables
Primary deliverable: **Confidence API** geospatial layer(s). Auxiliary QA or confidence bands may be included where the product line defines them. Delivery format and tiling follow the standard customer delivery spec for the order.

## Validation and performance
Validation approach is documented per supported vertical and region; request the validation memo for a specific AOI and season before quoting point accuracy.

## Limitations and failure modes
- Mixed pixels, poor atmospheric state, extreme canopy structure, and inadequate revisit can degrade retrievals. Always cross-check with QA masks.

## Operational notes
Indicative list rate in catalog: **$6/km²** (commercial placeholder until finance standardizes). Processing cadence and latency follow the order’s capture plan.

## Cross-links
See API Catalog in the playbook app for package associations; package layer lists are defined in code.
